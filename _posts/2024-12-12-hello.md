I'm Jack, and in 2025, I'm committed to learning more in public.

This blog is my space to document the interesting technologies and projects I'm working on, create and share guides and capture those "Today I Learned" moments that happen in my daily work. 

My aim is to create a transparent record of my technical journey and experience in the realm of cloud and platform engineering. By sharing my experiences, experiments, and insights, I hope to not just solidify my own growth, but potentially help others who might be exploring similar paths or problems.

Some posts may be detailed guides, whilst others might be quick observations – but all will be genuine attempts to share what I'm learning. 

With any luck, you'll find something useful here too.
