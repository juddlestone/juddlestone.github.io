# My blog.

This repository serves as my blog. Here, I will post guides, 'today I learned' findings, amongst other technical ramblings. I may also occasionally post other things I find interesting, we will see ðŸ™‚

## Jekyll
My blog is built with Jekyll. Which is perfect as it is the engine behind Github Pages, which means you can host your site for free.

> "Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator perfect for personal, project, or organization sites. Think of it like a file-based CMS, without all the complexity. Jekyll takes your content, renders Markdown and Liquid templates, and spits out a complete, static website ready to be served by Apache, Nginx or another web server."
